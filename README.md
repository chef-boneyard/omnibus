omnibus Cookbook
================

[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/omnibus.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/omnibus)

Prepares a machine to be an Omnibus builder.

This project is managed by the CHEF Release Engineering team. For more information on the Release Engineering team's contribution, triage, and release process, please consult the [CHEF Release Engineering OSS Management Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/opscode.com/document/d/1oJB0vZb_3bl7_ZU2YMDBkMFdL-EWplW1BJv_FXTUOzg/edit).

Announcement
------------
Starting with omnibus cookbook version 4.0.0, Chef 11 is no longer supported, since 12.5.1 is required to use [chef-ingredient](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-ingredient). If needed, you can pin to omnibus version `3.2.5` to preserve the old functionality.

Starting with 4.0.0, instead of compiling everything from source in this cookbook, the [omnibus-toolchain](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain) package will be installed. This package contains patch, bash, make, git, ruby, rubygems, and bundler (built from [omnibus-software](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-software) definitions).

Requirements
------------
This cookbook requires Chef 12.5.1+.

For a full list of supported platforms and external cookbook requirements, please see the `metadata.rb` file at the root of the cookbook.

Recipes
-------
The default recipe is the main entrypoint for the cookbook and does the following:

- Ensures all required Omnibus-related directories are created and owned by the build user.
- Ensures a sane build tool-chain is installed and configured (using the [build-essential](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) cookbook)
- Ensures the necessary tools to run an Omnibus project (ruby, git, etc) are installed (using the [omnibus-toolchain](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain) package)
- Includes a platform-specific recipe to apply additional tweaks as appropriate.

All other recipes should be treated as "private" and are not meant to be used individually. They only exist to support the `default` recipe.

#### Example Usage

```ruby
omnibus_build 'harmony' do
  project\_dir 'https://github.com/chef/omnibus-harmony.git'
  log_level :internal
  config_override(
    append_timestamp: true
  )
end
```

Usage
-----
Include the `omnibus::default` recipe in your node's run list and override the cookbook's default attributes as desired. At the very least you will want to override `node['omnibus']['install_dir']` to match the installation directory of your Omnibus project.

Using Test Kitchen with Docker
------------------------------

The following assumes you are on a Mac OS X workstation and have installed and
started [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/).

* Install [kitchen-docker](https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-docker) into your local ChefDK install:
```
$ chef gem install kitchen-docker
Successfully installed kitchen-docker-2.3.0
1 gem installed
```

* Set environment variables to point kitchen-docker at your local Kitematic instance:
```
# Bash
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=$HOME/.docker/machine/certs
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1

# Fish
set -gx DOCKER_HOST "tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
set -gx DOCKER_CERT_PATH "$HOME/.docker/machine/certs"
set -gx DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY 1
```

* Run Test Kitchen with the provided `.kitchen.docker.yml`:
```
KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=.kitchen.docker.yml kitchen verify languages-ruby-ubuntu-1204
```
