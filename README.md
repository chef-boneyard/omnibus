Recipes
-------
The default recipe is the main entrypoint for the cookbook and does the following:

- Ensures all required Omnibus-related directories are created and owned by the build user.
- Ensures a sane build tool-chain is installed and configured (using the [build-essential](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) cookbook)
- Ensures git is installed (using the [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) cookbook)
- Includes a platform-specific recipe to apply additional tweaks as appropriate.

All other recipes should be treated as "private" and are not meant to be used individually. They only exist to support the `default` recipe.


Attributes
----------
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>build_user</td>
    <td>User Omnibus build will be performed as</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>omnibus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>install_dir</td>
    <td>Installation directory of the Omnibus package</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>/opt/omnibus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cache_dir</td>
    <td>The directory the Omnibus project uses for caching</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>/var/cache/omnibus</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Usage
-----
Include the `omnibus::default` recipe in your node's run list and override the cookbook's default attributes as desired. At the very least you will want to override `node['omnibus']['install_dir']` to match the installation directory of your Omnibus project.

rake style        # Run all style checks
