# On FreeBSD the Ruby install's SSL points at `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` as the
# default root CA cert. This is actually the location of an optional symlink
# that the `ca_root_nss` port creates. We can't gurantee this optional
# symlink will exist so we'll just point `SSL_CERT_FILE` at the actual
# location of the root CA cert.
