# Ensure the build user's home directory exists
if windows?
  # Home directory creation on Windows is a mess. If a user's home is set to
  # the default location (e.g C:\Users\<USER>) then Chef cannot create the
  # directory because of permission issues (see CHEF-5264). The good news is
  # Windows will automaticlally create the directory BUT only after the user
  # has logged in the first time! We can force this behavior by executing a
  # trival command as the build user.
