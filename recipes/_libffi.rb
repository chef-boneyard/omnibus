# We need libffi 3.2.1 on ppc64/ppc64le systems in order
# for ruby ffi gem to get installed. Someday when ruby ffi
# updates embedded libffi 3.2.1 and fixes its extension
# build process to consume embedded libffi properly this wont
# be required. https://github.com/ffi/ffi/pull/424#issuecomment-83935000
